# crate2nix check backends: clippy, tests, doc, coverage.
#
# Layers on top of nix/crate2nix.nix's per-crate build graph.
# Dependencies are built ONCE with regular rustc (655 cached drvs);
# workspace members are re-built per-check with the appropriate
# driver (clippy-driver, rustc --test, rustdoc, rustc -Cinstrument-coverage).
#
# This is how you get per-crate caching for the CI gate — deps never
# re-clippy, never re-testcompile, never re-doc. Only the 10 workspace
# members get per-check rebuilds, and each of those caches independently.

  # Clippy wrapper
  # ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  #
  # buildRustCrate's lib.sh hardcodes `--cap-lints allow` (line 18 +
  # 55). rustc treats --cap-lints as non-overridable (later
  # occurrences are ignored — verified empirically: `rustc ...
  # --cap-lints allow --cap-lints warn` ≡ `--cap-lints allow`).
  #
  # To run clippy on workspace members without patching lib.sh, we
  # wrap clippy-driver in a fake "rustc" that strips `--cap-lints
  # allow` before forwarding. clippy-driver IS rustc internally (it
  # calls rustc_driver with extra lint passes), so the rlib output is
  # compatible with deps built by regular rustc — same rmeta format,
  # same metadata hash machinery.
  #
  # Dependencies stay on regular rustc (cached, --cap-lints allow —
  # we don't want a transitive dep's clippy pedantry blocking the
  # build). Only workspace members get this wrapper via .override.
  #
  # The wrapper also needs rustc itself in PATH because clippy-driver
  # resolves the sysroot from `rustc --print sysroot` at startup.
  # symlinkJoin bin/ with BOTH rustc (real) and cargo from the stable
  # toolchain, then override the rustc name with the wrapper script.
  # runCommand is simpler than wrapProgram here because we need the
  # arg-filtering logic, not just env injection.

  # nextest reuse-build runner
  # ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  #
  # nextest's `--binaries-metadata` + `--cargo-metadata` reuse-build
  # path is designed for exactly this "compile elsewhere, run here"
  # flow. We synthesize the metadata from the crate2nix test binaries
  # and point nextest at them — no cargo invocation, no target/ tree.
  # This gives us:
  #
  #   - Per-test-process isolation (fixes the PR_SET_PDEATHSIG/libtest
  #     thread-exit race; no wrapper-level PG bootstrap required).
  #   - Test groups, retry-on-flake, slow-timeout from
  #     `.config/nextest.toml`.
  #   - The characteristic `PASS [  Xs] crate::test` output format
  #     that log-parsers expect.
  #
  # The metadata synthesis has two pieces:
  #
  #   1. cargo-metadata.json — `cargo metadata --format-version 1` run
  #      offline against the workspace source. nextest reads package
  #      names, IDs, targets for filterset resolution (package(),
  #      binary(), test()). Vendoring the crates-io index would be
  #      insane for 3.3 MB of JSON; instead we dry-vendor with an
  #      empty .cargo/config pointing at a never-used registry and
  #      rely on `--offline` + `--no-deps` to skip network entirely.
  #      nextest's filterset only needs workspace members (the
  #      package() expressions in .config/nextest.toml are all
  #      workspace packages).
  #
  #   2. binaries-metadata.json — maps binary-id → binary-path. The
  #      binary-id is nextest's `<pkg>::<target>` naming (lib targets
  #      omit the `::<target>`). buildRustCrate's output naming
  #      diverges from cargo's target naming in two cases:
  #
  #        - lib test: buildRustCrate emits `<crate_name>-<hash>`
  #          (metadata hash suffix). We glob for it.
  #        - multi-file integration test (tests/foo/main.rs):
  #          buildRustCrate names it `foo_main`, cargo names it
  #          `foo`. lib.sh:85 derived_crate_name replaces / → _ then
  #          strips `tests_` prefix and `.rs` suffix; `tests/foo/main.rs`
  #          → `foo_main`. We strip `_main` when the cargo target name
  #          doesn't already end in `_main`.
  #
  #      Binary paths are ABSOLUTE nix-store paths — no target-dir-remap
  #      needed, nextest reads them directly.
  #
  # Split into two derivations: `nextestMeta` produces the JSON (cached,
  # only rebuilds when testBinDrvs change), `nextestRun` executes
  # against that metadata (the expensive part; what the CI gate checks).
  rustTarget = pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform.rust.rustcTarget;
