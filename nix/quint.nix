# Quint checks for formal protocol models in docs/spec/models/.
#
# Each model is a Quint specification (https://quint-lang.org — TLA+
# semantics behind a typed, effect-checked, programmer-facing syntax) of
# a distributed protocol that the prose spec in docs/spec/components/
# describes normatively. `quint verify` explores the state space and
# asserts the named invariants; a violation prints a step-by-step
# counterexample trace to the build log and fails the check.
#
# Why Quint next to Kani: nix/kani.nix proves *Rust-code* properties
# ("no panic, no overflow, postcondition holds") over rio-lease's
# functions. Quint proves *protocol* properties ("no two nodes ever both
# think they hold the lease") over the abstract distributed algorithm —
# the thing the Rust implements but cannot itself observe across nodes.
# Same crate, two complementary proof obligations. (The models here
# replaced a hand-written TLA+ toolchain; the port was validated against
# every documented result of its predecessor before the TLA+ artifacts
# were removed — the migration commits carry the evidence.)
#
# Backends — why the default is `tlc`, not quint's own default:
#   - `tlc`: transpiles the spec to TLA+ and runs TLC's parallel BFS over
#     the FULL reachable state space — an exhaustive check of every
#     reachable state, parallel across every core the build is allotted.
#     This is the CI backend.
#   - `apalache` (quint's own default if no --backend is given — which is
#     exactly why this constructor must default to `tlc`): bounded
#     symbolic model checking via one Z3 context, incrementally unrolled.
#     Single-threaded, and its cost is superlinear in the step bound —
#     measured at adoption time as an order of magnitude slower than the
#     tlc backend at its default 10-step bound and unable to complete a
#     20-step bound on a spec the tlc backend exhausts in under a second
#     (the figures are in the evaluation record and the introducing
#     commits). It proves "no violation within maxSteps steps", not "no
#     violation". Use it only for a property that is shallow by
#     construction, or in the dev loop where finding a shallow
#     counterexample in seconds beats waiting for the exhaustive run.
#
# The tlc backend requires a FINITE state space: every variable that can
# grow without bound (a counter, a resourceVersion, a clock) needs a
# ceiling as an action PRECONDITION in the .qnt itself (see the MAX_RV /
# MAX_TIME / MAX_GEN preconditions in leaderElection.qnt). Without one
# TLC never terminates. Apalache does not need the ceiling (it bounds by
# step count) but the ceiling must be present anyway so the same spec is
# checkable under both backends.
#
# Where the tools come from: pkgs.quint's bin/quint is a wrapper that puts
# its own JRE on PATH and sets QUINT_HOME to the package's share/quint,
# which carries the bundled Apalache distribution as a store path. The
# tlc backend runs `java -cp <QUINT_HOME>/apalache-dist-*/apalache/lib/
# apalache.jar tlc2.TLC` — TLC ships inside the Apalache jar, so neither
# backend needs pkgs.tlaplus, a network connection, or a writable HOME.
# The apalache backend starts a gRPC server on a fixed port (8822); the
# nix sandbox's private network namespace means parallel apalache-backend
# checks on one builder cannot collide on it.
#
# Caching: the .qnt model is the only eval-time input. Editing it
# rehashes the derivation and re-runs the checker. State space is
# bounded via the ceilings in the .qnt. A check around ~1min needs no
# further optimization; there is no hard ceiling, but a model over ~5min
# should be tuned if that's possible without losing the interleavings
# that make its invariants non-vacuous. A correct slow check beats a
# fast faulty one — never shrink constants past the point where a
# deliberately-weakened test stops producing its counterexample. A
# genuinely unbounded model belongs in a manual `packages.*` target,
# not here.
#
# r[verify ...] markers live HERE at the wiring point, not in the .qnt
# files — same discipline as nix/kani.nix's `kani-checks` attrset and
# nix/tests/default.nix's `subtests` entries: a marker at
# the wiring point structurally proves the check is built; a marker in
# the .qnt header would claim "verified" even if this file's attr were
# deleted. .config/tracey/config.styx must list nix/quint.nix under
# `test_include` for tracey to scan the markers.
#
# The checks reference their .qnt files unconditionally: a missing or
# renamed model file is a loud eval/build failure, never a silently
# absent check. (The bootstrap-era `lib.optionalAttrs (pathExists …)`
# gating that let the wiring land before the model was dropped once
# every wired model existed — a gated check whose model vanishes
# disappears from checks.* instead of failing, which converts "the
# proof is gone" into a silent coverage loss.)

    # binding + completeness gate, the per-stream ingest session and its
    # accept predicate, the immutable chunk manifest, the read path's

    # wall-clocks are in the introducing commit's message and each
