/// Upgrade an existing 'uploading' manifest to chunked: write manifest_data
/// + increment chunk refcounts.
///
/// # Why this takes an EXISTING placeholder
///
/// grpc.rs PutPath runs `insert_manifest_uploading()` at step 3, BEFORE
/// the NAR stream is consumed (it's the idempotency lock — prevents
/// concurrent uploaders). Only at step 6, after buffering + validating,
/// do we know the size. At that point we already OWN the placeholder;
/// this function adds the chunked metadata to it.
///
/// A standalone `insert_manifest_chunked_uploading` that creates its own
/// placeholder would either (a) need to know the size upfront (can't —
/// stream isn't consumed yet), or (b) delete+recreate the placeholder
/// (window for another uploader to slip in). Upgrade-in-place avoids both.
///
/// # Why refcounts are incremented here (before upload), not at complete
///
/// Per `store.md:94`: incrementing before upload protects chunks from GC
/// sweep immediately. If a GC pass runs between upload and complete, it
/// sees refcount > 0 and skips. If we waited until complete, a GC between
/// "chunks uploaded to S3" and "status flipped" would sweep → orphaned.
///
/// The tradeoff: if the upload fails and we forget to decrement, refcounts
/// are leaked. The orphan scanner (future phase) catches this via stale
/// 'uploading' manifests.
///
/// # Refcount UPSERT
///
/// `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` is row-level atomic — no explicit
/// SELECT FOR UPDATE needed. Two concurrent PutPaths referencing the same
/// chunk both increment correctly (PG resolves the conflict, second one
/// sees the first's row and runs the UPDATE clause).
