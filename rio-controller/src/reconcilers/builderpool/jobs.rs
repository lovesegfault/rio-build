//! BuilderPool Job-per-build reconciler.
//!
//!   1. Each `apply()` tick polls `ClusterStatus.queued_derivations`
//!      via the same `ctx.admin` client the finalizer uses for
//!      DrainExecutor.
//!   2. If `queued > 0` and active Jobs for this pool <
//!      `spec.maxConcurrent`, spawn Jobs (one per outstanding
//!      derivation, up to the ceiling).
//!   3. Each Job runs one rio-builder pod → worker exits after one
//!      build → pod terminates → `ttlSecondsAfterFinished`
//!      ([`JOB_TTL_SECS`]) reaps the Job.
//!
//! From the scheduler's perspective a Job pod is just an executor:
//! it heartbeats in, gets a dispatch, sends CompletionReport,
//! disconnects. The "ephemeral" property is purely worker-side
//! (exit after one build) + controller-side (Job lifecycle).
//!
//! # Why not a Scheduler→Controller RPC
//!
//! A push-mode RPC (scheduler calls controller at dispatch time)
//! was considered and rejected. It would require: controller gains
//! a gRPC server (it has none today), scheduler gains a "pool"
//! concept (it has none — only workers with size_class), and new
//! connection management / RBAC / NetworkPolicy.
//!
//! Polling ClusterStatus achieves the same outcome (Job spawned when
//! work exists) with existing infrastructure. Latency is one
//! reconciler requeue interval (~10s). For the "untrusted multi-
//! tenant" use case where isolation > throughput, 10s added latency
//! is acceptable. If
//! sub-second dispatch later becomes a hard requirement, an RPC
//! path can be reintroduced WITH an implementer — don't land
//! declaration-only proto (the previous speculative
//! `ControllerService.CreateEphemeralWorker` was removed for
//! exactly that reason).
//!
//! # Job naming
//!
//! `rio-builder-{pool}-{random-suffix}` — random because we don't have an
//! assignment_id at spawn time (the scheduler picks the derivation
//! AFTER the worker heartbeats). 6 lowercase-alnum chars: 36^6 ≈
//! 2 billion combinations; with [`JOB_TTL_SECS`] reaping and
//! realistic build rates, collision is effectively impossible. K8s
//! would reject on collision anyway (409 AlreadyExists) and next
//! tick retries.
//!
//! # Zero cross-build state
//!
//! Fresh pod = fresh emptyDir for FUSE cache + overlays. An
//! untrusted tenant CANNOT leave poisoned cache entries for the
//! next build — there is no "next build" on that pod.
