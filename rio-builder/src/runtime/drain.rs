/// the test-and-set), set `draining=true` and spawn the idle-watcher
/// → `drain_done` notifier. The reconnect loop then KEEPS RUNNING —
/// completions for an in-flight build reach the current leader (even
/// across scheduler restart) via the same relay machinery as steady-
/// state. Exit when `drain_done` fires (in_flight=0).
///
/// I-195 idle fast-path: returns `Break` when `draining` AND the slot
/// is idle. The reconnect-under-drain machinery exists so an in-flight
/// build's CompletionReport reaches the leader; an idle slot has
/// nothing to report. Re-registering would bump the scheduler's
/// `workers_active`, and the heartbeat task (aborted only AFTER the
/// loop exits) keeps `last_heartbeat` fresh until process exit. Under
/// coverage instrumentation the profraw atexit write delays exit by
/// ~80s (GHA 24018216226) — `cov_factor` in `lifecycle.nix` band-
/// aided that; this is the structural fix. Covers both the first
/// SIGTERM iteration with an already-idle slot AND any later
/// iteration where the slot has since gone idle (e.g. build completed
/// during a stream-retry sleep).
