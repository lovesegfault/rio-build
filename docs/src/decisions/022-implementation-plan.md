# ADR-022 Implementation Plan — composefs-style lazy store + per-AZ FSx chunk cache

**Status:** sequencing only — design is [ADR-022 §2](./022-lazy-store-fs-erofs-vs-riofs.md) + [Design Overview](./022-design-overview.md) + ADR-023.
**Plan-number range:** P0541–P0578 (gaps at 0542/0547/0558 are abandoned numbers; do not reuse).
**Clean-cutover constraint:** no FUSE fallback flag, no `RIO_STORE_BACKEND` selector. P0560 deletes the old FUSE module wholesale.
**Cross-region forward-compat:** object store (S3/GCS) is authoritative for bytes; FSx is a per-AZ read-through cache; PG is single-region. Nothing here precludes cross-region deployment (object-store-authoritative, cache tier stateless) but it is not implemented. No DRA.
**Migration-number range:** `033_*` (last shipped: `032_derivations_size_class_floor.sql`).

## How we got here

The pre-ADR-022 builder serves `/nix/store` via FUSE with whole-store-path JIT fetch — every `stat`/`readdir` is a userspace upcall, and a partially-hot 200 MB `.so` either upcalls every read or blocks `open()` for the whole file. Two kernel-filesystem replacements were evaluated and set aside ([ADR-022 §3](./022-lazy-store-fs-erofs-vs-riofs.md#3-alternatives-considered)): EROFS+fscache (cachefiles daemon, device-slot table, per-path S3 artifact) and a custom `riofs` kmod (~800 LoC novel kernel C). A composefs-style stack — EROFS metadata + overlayfs redirect → digest-addressed FUSE — was then spiked at chromium scale and found to dominate both: <10 ms mount, zero warm-read upcalls, structural per-file dedup, ~half the owned code, zero kernel code. Two follow-on spikes closed the open questions: the unprivileged-userns mount works via `userxattr` + a small privileged helper (`rio-mountd`), and `FOPEN_KEEP_CACHE` handles giant partially-read files without a mode transition. The spike evidence below is the validation record; everything else in this document is forward-looking sequencing.

## Spike evidence

Core-stack nixosTests consolidated on `adr-022` (commit `15a9db79`); chromium-146 closure topology (357 store paths, 23 218 regular files, 8 221 dirs, 3 374 symlinks) with synthetic content.

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| `mount -t overlay` wall-clock | **<10 ms**; 0 FUSE upcalls during mount |
| `find -type f` over 23 218 files | 60 ms, **0 FUSE upcalls** |
| `find -printf %s` sum | matches manifest; 120 ms, 0 upcalls |
| Cold `lookup` upcalls (any depth) | **2** (depth-independent) |
| Warm `read` upcalls | **0** |
| Metadata image (chromium closure) | **5.3 MiB**, encoded in **70 ms** |

**Privilege-boundary evidence** (P0541, commit `af8db499` on `adr-022`, kernel 6.18.20) — all six PASS:

| Subtest | Result |
|---|---|
| `userns-overlay` | PASS — unpriv builder mounts overlay itself with `-o ro,userxattr,lowerdir=<meta>::<objects>`. **Gotcha:** explicit `metacopy=on`/`redirect_dir=on` are **rejected** under `userxattr` (`params.c:988-1008`). The `::` data-only lower independently enables redirect-following — gated on `ofs->numdatalayer > 0` (`namei.c:1241`, [`5ef7bcdeecc9`](https://git.kernel.org/linus/5ef7bcdeecc9), v6.16+), not `config->metacopy`. |
| `userns-fuse-self` | PASS — builder cannot `open("/dev/fuse")` without `privileged:true` or device-plugin, but with fd-handoff it never needs to: `rio-mountd` opens+mounts in init-ns, passes the connected fd. **Builder pod drops `smarter-devices/fuse:1` entirely.** |
| `kvm-hostpath-spike` (`9492019c` on `adr-022`) | PASS — Nix sandbox sees `/dev/kvm` via `extra-sandbox-paths` + char-device hostPath; `requiredSystemFeatures=["kvm"]` build does `ioctl(KVM_GET_API_VERSION)` → 12. **smarter-device-manager dropped entirely** — `/dev/kvm` is a capability flag (node label + hostPath), not a counted resource. |
| `erofs-loop-unpriv` | FAIL as expected (`EPERM`) — confirms P0567 mandatory. |
| `fsmount-handoff-erofs` | PASS — **Gotcha:** `fsconfig(FSCONFIG_SET_FLAG, "ro")` must precede `CMD_CREATE` or `move_mount` later fails `EROFS`. |
| `fuse-dev-fd-handoff` | PASS — `/dev/fuse` fd via SCM_RIGHTS works; `fuser` accepts pre-opened fd. |
| `teardown-under-load` | PASS — reader wakes `ENOTCONN` <1s, no D-state. |

**Passthrough validation** is **P0578** (separate spike — P0541 is DONE and must stay DONE for the dag-runner).

**Gotcha (ordering):** `/dev/fuse` fd MUST be received and the digest-FUSE serving **before** the overlay mount — overlayfs probes lowers at `mount(2)`; an unserved FUSE deadlocks the mounter.

**§2.7 large-file evidence** (P0575 promoted to critical-path on this basis):

| Commit / source | Finding |
|---|---|
| nix-index `top1000.csv` (external dataset, 2026-04-05) | nixpkgs top-1000 files: **all >64 MiB** (min 117 MiB, median 179 MiB, 267 >256 MiB, 7 >1 GiB). 248 are `.so`/`.a`. Floor — proprietary closures worse. |
| `42aa81b2` (`adr-022`, `nix/tests/lib/spike-access-data/RESULTS.md`) | Real consumers read **0.3-33%** of giants: link-time `libLLVM.so` 2.79% bimodal head+tail; `opt --version` 32.77% scattered/266 ranges; `libicudata` preload 0.28%. No `MAP_POPULATE`/`fadvise`. |
| `15a9db79` (`adr-022`, `composefs-spike-stream.nix`) | Streaming-open mechanism PASS: 256 MiB `open()` = **10.3 ms** (vs 2560 ms whole-file); `FOPEN_KEEP_CACHE` from start → 2nd `dd` **0 read upcalls**; `mmap` page-faults route through FUSE `read`; **no mode-transition needed** (KEEP_CACHE doesn't suppress cold upcalls, only prevents invalidation). |
| alternatives survey | File-splitting at encoder **infeasible** (overlayfs `redirect` is single-path). Allowlist prefetch **violates JIT-fetch imperative**. FSx-backed cluster-wide objects cache **rejected** — violates builder air-gap. |

**Key encoder findings** (now ADR-022 §2.2): stub inodes MUST carry real `i_size`. The metacopy xattr must be 0-length or ≥4 bytes (`struct ovl_metacopy{u8 version,len,flags,digest_algo}`). **Unpriv overlay (P0541) requires `user.overlay.{redirect,metacopy}`, NOT `trusted.*`** — overlayfs under `userxattr` reads only the `user.` prefix; the nix-carried `libcomposefs` patch adds `LCFS_BUILD_USER_XATTR_OVERLAY` so the writer emits `user.*` directly (and `LCFS_FLAGS_NO_ROOT_WHITEOUTS` to skip the 256 OCI whiteout chardevs). fs-verity-in-metacopy doesn't verify when the lower is FUSE — per-file integrity lives in the digest-FUSE handler (§2.6).

## Prerequisites (in flight separately — NOT phased here)

| Track | Status | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| **NixOS node cutover** (full Bottlerocket replacement) | dispatched (`nixos-cutover` agent) | `nix/nixos-node/{hardening,kernel}.nix`, `karpenter.yaml` amiSelectorTerms→tag, `xtask ami push`, ADR-021 |
| `kernel.nix` standalone module with `EROFS_FS=y OVERLAY_FS=y FUSE_FS=y FUSE_PASSTHROUGH=y`, **kernel ≥6.16** ([`5ef7bcdeecc9`](https://git.kernel.org/linus/5ef7bcdeecc9): data-only-lower redirect honored under `userxattr`; subsumes ≥6.9 `FUSE_PASSTHROUGH` [`7dc4e97a4f9a`](https://git.kernel.org/linus/7dc4e97a4f9a)) | part of cutover | `nix/nixos-node/kernel.nix` — **MUST be importable by `nix/tests/fixtures/`** so VM tests reuse the AMI's exact config. **No `EROFS_FS_ONDEMAND`, no `CACHEFILES*`.** Module asserts version at boot. |
| Device exposure: **no smarter-device-manager** | part of cutover | `/dev/fuse` → fd-handoff from `rio-mountd` DS (P0567); `/dev/kvm` → `hostPath{type:CharDevice}` + `nodeSelector{rio.build/kvm}` on kvm-pool pods + `extra-sandbox-paths=["/dev/kvm"]` in builder nix.conf. `nix/nixos-node/static-pods.nix` drops the device-plugin pod. |

**This plan assumes the cutover lands first.** No old-FUSE fallback — same greenfield cutover as Bottlerocket→NixOS. Rollback for builder-side regressions is `xtask k8s eks down && up` from a known-green commit.

**Greenfield deployment constraint** (settled 2026-04-04, unchanged): we control the only deployment. Migration path is `xtask k8s eks down && up`. NO backfill jobs, NO old-binary compat shims, NO dual-read paths. When this plan's phases are ready to flip on, tear down + redeploy.

---

## User journeys (every phase traces to one)

| ID | User | Journey | Today | After |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **U1** | build submitter | `nix build .#chromium`; closure 200 GB, build reads 5% | builder fetches whole touched store-paths (~per-path JIT, rev 63); warm reads via FUSE passthrough but cold = whole NAR | builder fetches **only the files the build opens**, on-demand, at file granularity; `stat`/`readdir` are kernel-native; warm reads = page-cache, zero crossings; identical files across store paths share one node-SSD copy and one page-cache copy |
| **U2** | operator | scales `rio-store` 3→12 under load | each replica cold-misses S3 independently; 12× GET cost; 12× moka warm-up | per-AZ FSx cache tier serves all replicas in that AZ; new replica is warm; S3 GET only on first-in-AZ cold miss. Cache-tier-AZ down → cold reads from S3, not outage. |
| **U3** | operator | something is wrong at 02:00 | unclear which layer | one single-flag rollback for cache tier (`store.chunkBackend.kind=s3`, instant + lossless); builder-side rollback is greenfield `down && up` from known-green commit |
| **U4** | operator | wants to know if the new path is better | no per-file metrics | grafana: `rio_builder_digest_fuse_open_seconds` p99, `…_fetch_bytes_total{hit=node_ssd|remote}`, `rio_store_tiered_local_hit_ratio` |
| **U5** | deployment consumer | `nix copy --from rio-store` to a **rio-aware** receiver (rio-store replica, or host running rio-gateway proxy) that already has 95% of the target closure | walks chunk-list per store path; O(all-chunks) `HasChunk` RPCs even for unchanged paths | walks Directory DAG; `HasDirectories([root_digest,…])` short-circuits unchanged subtrees in one batch RPC; fetches only changed files. **Sync bandwidth ∝ change size, not closure size.** Stock-nix clients without `HasDirectories` fall through to P0566's narinfo/NAR binary-cache surface. |

**Sequencing rule (U3, unchanged):** every phase boundary is `.#ci` green. Phases 0-4 are deploy-safe (store-side or test-only). Phase 5 (P0560) is the hard cutover: builders REQUIRE the composefs lower from that commit forward.

**Hidden dependencies surfaced:**

| Edge | Why it's non-obvious |
|---|---|
| P0549 blob-API → P0566 | `ChunkBackend` trait today is `[u8;32]`-addressed only (`rio-store/src/backend/chunk.rs:91`). `narinfo/{h}` / `manifests/{h}` need string-keyed `put_blob/get_blob/delete_blob`. |
| P0576 (kernel.nix sentinel) → P0560 | Test-VM kernel must have the same `extraStructuredConfig` as the AMI. `kernel.nix` MUST be a standalone NixOS module importable by `nix/tests/fixtures/`. |
| P0550 fetch.rs hoist → P0559 | `rio-builder/src/fuse/fetch.rs:20,32-33` import `fuser::Errno`, `super::NixStoreFs`, `super::cache`. **NOT a pure `git mv`** — hoist `StoreClients` + `fetch_chunks_parallel` core to `store_fetch.rs`; leave FUSE-typed wrappers in `fuse/fetch.rs` *temporarily* (P0560 deletes them with the rest of `fuse/`). ~150 LoC of actual refactor, not zero. |
| P0544 spec-scaffold → everything with `r[impl …]` | `tracey-validate` in `.#ci` fails on dangling `r[impl X]` where `r[X]` has no spec text. Markers must be on `sprint-1` before any code phase merges. |
| P0548 → P0553 | Terraform may land first, but the helm flip to `kind: tiered` MUST NOT — `TieredChunkBackend` semantics (S3-sync put, FS write-through on get) are what make the cache tier safe to enable. |
| P0541 (all 6 PASS) → P0567 minimal | EROFS lacks `FS_USERNS_MOUNT`; builder also can't open `/dev/fuse` unprivileged. `rio-mountd` (init-ns `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`) opens `/dev/fuse` + does `fsopen("erofs")/fsconfig("ro")/fsmount` → SCM_RIGHTS **both** fds → exits. Builder receives fds, serves digest-FUSE on the fuse-fd, `move_mount()`s the erofs-fd, then mounts overlay itself in its userns (`userxattr`). |
| P0546 blake3 → P0570 | `DigestResolver` keys by `file_digest`; the digest must exist in `NarIndexEntry` before the resolver can be built. |
| P0546 ↔ P0572 | `dir_digest` is computed bottom-up over `file_digest` of children — same pass, same RAM. P0572 extends P0546's `nar_ls` rather than re-walking. |
| P0573 batch RPCs ← I-110 lesson | per-digest unary `HasDirectory` against a 50k-node DAG is the I-110 PG-wall again. `HasDirectories([digest]) → bitmap` and `HasBlobs([file_digest]) → bitmap` are batch from day one. |
| P0571 → P0560 | Node-SSD cache is the digest-FUSE's backing dir; mount sequence in P0560 references `/var/rio/objects`. If P0571 slips, P0560 uses `tmpfs` (loses cross-build amortization but functions). |
| P0575 → P0560 | streaming-open is part of `digest_fuse.rs`; P0560's `vm-composefs-e2e cold-read` exercises it. P0575 must land before §B's <500 ms assertion is meaningful. |

## Phase 0 — Spike gate + scaffold (de-risk before committing)

Spikes are throwaway on `spike/*` branches; results captured in `.stress-test/sessions/2026-04-NN-phase0-gate.md`. P0543/P0544 ship to sprint-1.

### P0569 — SPIKE sentinel: composefs-style validated
**Crate:** `spike` · **Deps:** none · **Complexity:** — · **Status: DONE 2026-04-05**

Dependency-tracking row only. Consolidated as `15a9db79` on `adr-022` (originals `9c162024`/`a1394c0b`/`9415f9e2`); see §Spike evidence. **Exit met:** mount <10 ms, warm read = 0 upcalls, `stat` correct via `mkcomposefs`, depth-independent cold lookup. ADR-022 reopened in C's favor (`adr-022` `4a716900`..`b6794962`).

### P0541 — SPIKE: composefs privilege boundary + mount handoff
**Status: DONE — all six subtests PASS** (commit `af8db499` on `adr-022`, kernel 6.18.20). Results table in §Spike evidence above. Confirms overlay mount stays in the unprivileged builder via `userxattr`.
**Files:** `nix/tests/scenarios/spike-composefs-priv.nix` — VM imports `nixos-node/kernel.nix`; runs as unpriv-userns user.

### P0578 — SPIKE: passthrough-under-overlay + brokered `BACKING_OPEN`

**Exit:**

PG `chunk_refs` is single-writer arbiter (single-region). **No DRA.** Forward-compat for cross-region: cache tier is stateless and metadata-agnostic; object-store cross-region replication + a globally-consistent metadata store would suffice, but neither is in scope here. Explicitly states: any single cache-tier-AZ outage = that AZ's replicas cold-read from S3, not service outage; rollback `kind=s3` is instant + lossless. Carries `r[infra.fsx.cache-tier]`. |

## Phase 1 — Primitives (≤7-way parallel; all dep on P0544)

### P0545 — proto: NarIndex with `file_digest`
**Crate:** `rio-proto` · **Deps:** P0544 · **Complexity:** LOW
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `rio-proto/proto/types.proto` | `message NarIndexEntry { bytes path=1; Kind kind=2; uint64 size=3; bool executable=4; uint64 nar_offset=5; bytes target=6; bytes file_digest=7; }` — `path`/`target` are `bytes` not `string` (NAR names are arbitrary non-NUL/non-slash bytes; non-UTF8 is legal). `file_digest` is blake3 of regular-file content (32 bytes; empty for dirs/symlinks). `message NarIndex { repeated NarIndexEntry entries=1; }` |
| `rio-proto/proto/store.proto` | `rpc GetNarIndex(...)`; `rpc GetNarIndexBatch(NarHashList) returns (stream NarIndexResponse)` (build-start fetches ~357 indices; batch avoids per-path RTT) |
| `xtask regen mocks` | run |

**Exit:** `.#ci` green.

### P0546 — rio-nix: streaming `nar_ls` + blake3-per-file
**Crate:** `rio-nix` · **Deps:** P0544, P0545 · **Complexity:** MED
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `rio-nix/src/nar.rs` | `pub fn nar_ls<R: Read>(r) -> Result<Vec<NarLsEntry>>` — sibling to `parse()` (~line 238); **single forward pass, no `Seek`, bounded memory regardless of NAR size.** Maintains a running byte counter for `nar_offset`; for `Regular`, records the offset after the `"contents"` length-prefix, then streams the `size` bytes through `blake3::Hasher` in 64 KiB blocks (bytes touched once, never buffered whole). `NarLsEntry { …, file_digest: [u8;32] }`. `// r[impl store.index.nar-ls-offset]` `// r[impl store.index.file-digest]` `// r[impl store.index.nar-ls-streaming]` |

| tests | proptest: `serialize(tree)` → `nar_ls` → `&nar[off..off+size] == content` AND `file_digest == blake3(content)`; explicit test with reader wrapper that panics on `seek()`. `// r[verify ...]` |

The `Read+Seek` variant is not implemented — callers that have a `Vec<u8>` wrap it in `Cursor` and the streaming impl is no slower.

**Exit:** `.#ci` green incl. `fuzz-nar_ls`.

### P0548 — TieredChunkBackend (object-store authoritative; local-FS read-through cache)
**Crate:** `rio-store` · **Deps:** P0544 · **Complexity:** MED
`rio-store/src/backend/tiered.rs`: `put` = S3 sync then FSx best-effort; `get` = FSx → S3 fallback + write-through. `rio-store/src/backend/fs.rs`: idempotent file-per-chunk under `<root>/ab/<digest>`. `// r[impl store.backend.{tiered-get-fallback,tiered-put-remote-first,fs-put-idempotent}]`. **Exit:** `.#ci` green.

### P0549 — ChunkBackend blob-API
**Crate:** `rio-store` · **Deps:** P0544, P0548 · **Complexity:** LOW
Extend `ChunkBackend` with string-keyed `put_blob/get_blob/delete_blob` for P0566's `narinfo/`/`manifests/` sidecars (the `[u8;32]`-addressed chunk API can't express named objects). **Exit:** `.#ci` green.

### P0568 — Batched `GetChunks` server-stream + prost-bytes + tonic residuals + obs
**Crate:** `rio-proto, rio-store, rio-builder` · **Deps:** P0545, P0550 · **Complexity:** MED
`rpc GetChunks(stream GetChunksRequest) returns (stream ChunkData)` with `K_server=256` server-side fan-out; `prost(bytes = "bytes")` for zero-copy; tonic `adaptive_window`. Spike-validated `spike/rtt-bench` @ `96cfd098`. The digest-FUSE `open` handler (P0559) is the consumer. **Exit:** `.#ci` green; live A/B ≥4× cold-fetch reduction.

### P0550 — fetch.rs core hoist (NOT a pure mv)
**Crate:** `rio-builder` · **Deps:** P0544 · **Complexity:** MED
Hoist `StoreClients` + `fetch_chunks_parallel` from `rio-builder/src/fuse/fetch.rs` (which imports `fuser::Errno`, `super::NixStoreFs`) to `rio-builder/src/store_fetch.rs`; leave old-FUSE-typed wrappers in `fuse/fetch.rs` until P0560 deletes them. ~150 LoC actual refactor. **Exit:** `.#ci` green; existing FUSE VM tests unchanged.

### P0572 — Directory merkle layer: `dir_digest`/`root_digest` + `directories` table
**Crate:** `rio-proto, rio-nix, rio-store` · **Deps:** P0545, P0546 · **Complexity:** LOW (~50 LoC compute + table)

Closes the subtree-merkle gap vs snix at **zero serving-path cost** — the mount stack and digest-FUSE are unaffected. The work happens once at PutPath/index time (<1 ms on top of P0546's blake3 pass; bytes already in RAM).

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `rio-proto/proto/types.proto` | `NarIndexEntry { …; bytes dir_digest = 8; }` (populated when `kind==DIR`; blake3 of canonical Directory encoding); `NarIndex { …; bytes root_digest = 2; }` |
| `rio-proto/proto/castore.proto` | new — vendor snix [`castore.proto`](https://git.snix.dev/snix/snix/raw/branch/canon/snix/castore/protos/castore.proto) (MIT): `message Directory { repeated DirectoryNode directories; repeated FileNode files; repeated SymlinkNode symlinks; }` with `FileNode{name, digest, size, executable}`, `DirectoryNode{name, digest, size}`, `SymlinkNode{name, target}`. **Pin canonical encoding rule** in a doc-comment: fields sorted by `name` (bytes-lex), no unknown fields, prost's default field-order encode. **snix issue #111**: prost determinism is not formally guaranteed across versions — add a golden-bytes test that fails loudly on encoder drift. `// r[impl store.castore.canonical-encoding]` |
| `rio-nix/src/nar.rs` | `nar_ls` second pass (bottom-up over the entry list, deepest-first): for each `kind==DIR`, build `Directory{…}` from immediate children's `file_digest`/`dir_digest`/`target`, encode, `dir_digest = blake3(encoded)`. `root_digest` = top dir's `dir_digest`. ~50 LoC. `// r[impl store.index.dir-digest]` |

| tests | proptest: `serialize(tree)` → `nar_ls` → re-derive `dir_digest` from children == stored value. snix-interop golden: known tree → `root_digest` matches snix's `tvix-store import` output (fixture bytes pinned). **GC**: PutPath A and B sharing a subtree → `directories.refcount==2` for the shared digest → GC A → `refcount==1` → GC B → row gone. `// r[verify store.index.dir-digest]` `// r[verify store.castore.{canonical-encoding,gc}]` |

**Measured benefit today is small** (12.1% dir-sharing on chromium, ~90% of which is empty dirs; no subtree-integrity consumer in `security.md`). This is **optionality** that becomes load-bearing under U5: snix `castore.proto` interop + `root_digest` as a closure-level cache key + the Directory DAG that P0573/P0574 walk.

**Exit:** `.#ci` green; `dir_digest`/`root_digest` populated for all regular paths; golden-bytes encoding test pinned.

### P0570 — `DigestResolver`: `file_digest → chunk-fetch coords`
**Crate:** `rio-builder` · **Deps:** P0544, P0545, P0550 · **Complexity:** LOW
| File | Change |

| tests | proptest: synth N NARs with overlapping files → resolver returns coords whose `&nar[range] blake3 == digest`. `// r[verify ...]` |

**Exit:** `.#ci` green.

PG forbids subqueries in partial-index predicates, so the queue is a same-table bool flag; indexer flips `nar_indexed=true` on success (HOT-update eligible). |

## Phase 3 — Cache-tier infra (parallel with Phase 2; depends only P0548)  ★ FIRST SHIPPED VALUE (U2)

### P0553 — terraform: per-AZ FSx cache tier + dedicated store SG/NodeClass + csi-driver
**Crate:** `infra` · **Deps:** P0548 · **Complexity:** LOW

**One `aws_fsx_lustre_file_system` per AZ** (`for_each = toset(local.azs)`), each in that AZ's private subnet. Store pods mount the FSx for their own AZ via a per-AZ PVC (P0554's zone-pin already routes this). `TieredChunkBackend` is AZ-count-agnostic — each store replica sees exactly one local-FS path; the terraform just provisions N of them.

**Exit:** `tofu apply` creates one FSx per AZ + store SG/NodeClass; `.#ci` green.

**Crate:** `infra, xtask` · **Deps:** P0548, P0553 · **Complexity:** MED
Per-AZ PVC bound to that AZ's FSx (via `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer` + `nodeAffinity` zone-pin); `store.chunkBackend.kind={s3|tiered}` helm value, default `s3`. **Exit:** `helm template --set store.chunkBackend.kind=tiered` renders; `.#ci` green. ★ FIRST SHIPPED VALUE (U2)

### P0555 — VM test: tiered-backend cache semantics
**Crate:** `nix` · **Deps:** P0548, P0554 · **Complexity:** MED

### P0566 — Self-describing S3 bucket (narinfo + manifest sidecar, direct object-store write)
**Crate:** `rio-store` · **Deps:** P0549, P0554 · **Complexity:** LOW
At PutPath commit, additionally write `narinfo/<hash>.narinfo` and `manifests/<hash>.json` directly to the object store via `put_blob` so the bucket is browsable/restorable without PG. **Exit:** `.#ci` green; live `aws s3 ls narinfo/` non-empty.

## Phase 5 — composefs builder-side

### P0559 — `composefs/{digest_fuse,circuit}.rs`
**Crate:** `rio-builder` · **Deps:** P0545, P0550, P0567, P0568, P0570 · **Complexity:** MED (~500 LoC)
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `rio-builder/src/composefs/digest_fuse.rs` | `fuser::Filesystem` impl rooted at the per-build mount `/var/rio/objects/{build_id}` exposing exactly two levels: 256 prefix dirs (`00`..`ff`, static inodes 2-257) + leaf files named by remaining 62 hex chars. **Startup**: `setrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, 65536)` — a chromium link opens ~2-3k `.so`/`.a` concurrently; default 1024 would `EMFILE`. **`init`**: `config.set_max_stack_depth(1)` (negotiates `FUSE_PASSTHROUGH`; `fuser` ≥0.17, [lib.rs:254](https://github.com/cberner/fuser/blob/master/src/lib.rs)). `lookup(parent, name)`: parent==ROOT → prefix-dir inode; parent==prefix → parse `[prefix‖name]` as `[u8;32]`, `resolver.resolve(digest)` → `FileAttr{ size, mode: if executable {0o555} else {0o444}, ino: hash-derived }`; unknown → `ENOENT` (declared-input allowlist — JIT-fetch imperative). **`open(ino)`**: look up backing path in **shared node-SSD cache** `/var/rio/cache/{aa}/{rest}` (P0571). **(a) hit** (`/var/rio/cache/` is mountd-owned, builder-readonly) → open cache file O_RDONLY, send fd to rio-mountd UDS (`BackingOpen{fd}`, SCM_RIGHTS) → recv `backing_id: u32` → `let bid = BackingId::create_raw(backing_id); self.backing.insert(fh, backing_id); reply.opened_passthrough(fh, flags, &bid)` ([`fuser::ReplyOpen`/`BackingId::create_raw`](https://github.com/cberner/fuser/blob/master/src/reply.rs); the ioctl runs in mountd because `BACKING_OPEN` needs init-ns `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`). **(b) miss + `size ≤ STREAM_THRESHOLD`** → `O_EXCL`-create `staging/{build_id}/<hex>.partial` + `flock(LOCK_EX)` (within-build concurrent open of same digest: loser `flock(LOCK_NB)` — held → condvar-wait on a per-digest `Notify`, then re-check cache; not held → orphan, unlink + retry); `circuit.call(‖ store_fetch::fetch_chunks_parallel(...))` into `.partial`, **verifying each chunk's blake3 on arrival** (§2.6); whole-file verify; `rename .partial → <hex>`; `Promote{digest}` (mountd opens `staging/<hex>` — no suffix) → as (a). **(c) miss + `size > STREAM_THRESHOLD`** → P0575 streaming path. Chunk source: check `/var/rio/chunks/ab/<chunk_hex>` (RO) first; for misses, `GetChunks` → verify → write `staging/chunks/<chunk_hex>` → fire `PromoteChunk` (fire-and-forget). Assemble into `.partial` from chunks. Reply `FOPEN_KEEP_CACHE` after first chunk; fill+`Promote` in background. **Cross-build dedup is chunk-granular and automatic** — concurrent fillers race on `PromoteChunk`'s rename; no sentinel, no leader. **`read(ino, fh, off, size)`**: only reached for case (c) — `pread` the staging `.partial`; see P0575. **`release(fh)`**: if `self.backing.remove(&fh)` had an id, send `BackingClose{id}` (case-c opens have none). **BackingId LRU**: `self.backing` is an `LruCache` capped at `MAX_BACKING_IDS` (4096); on insert-evict, `BackingClose` the victim (next read of that fd falls back to FUSE `read` from cache file — still correct, just one extra crossing). All mountd UDS sends wrapped in `timeout(mountd_request_timeout)` (default 30 s; `Promote` of a streamed file uses `max(30s, 2×size/(1 GiB/s))`); expiry → `EIO` + infra-retry. Per-open `tokio::time::timeout(jit_fetch_timeout)` on the fetch; expiry → `EIO`. Prototype: `rio-builder/src/bin/spike_digest_fuse.rs` on `adr-022` (`af8db499`). `// r[impl builder.fs.{digest-fuse-open,passthrough-on-hit,file-digest-integrity,shared-backing-cache}]` |
| `rio-builder/src/config.rs` | `+ mountd_request_timeout: Duration` (30 s); `+ disable_passthrough: bool` (env `RIO_DISABLE_PASSTHROUGH` — when true, case (a) replies `FOPEN_KEEP_CACHE` over the cache file with no `BackingOpen`; escape hatch). |
| `rio-builder/src/lib.rs` | `+ rio_builder_digest_fuse_open_mode_total{mode="passthrough"\|"keep_cache"}`; `+ rio_builder_digest_fuse_open_case_total{case="hit"\|"miss_small"\|"miss_stream"}`; `+ rio_builder_digest_fuse_chunk_source_total{src="node_chunks"\|"remote"}` (I-056: expose every gate input). |
| `rio-builder/src/composefs/circuit.rs` | port of `fuse/circuit.rs` — breaker around `fetch_chunks_parallel`. A store outage must trip the breaker, not stream EIOs into every `open()` on the node. `// r[impl builder.fs.fetch-circuit]` |
| `rio-builder/src/composefs/mod.rs` | `pub mod digest_fuse; pub mod circuit; pub mod resolver; pub mod dump; pub mod encode; pub mod mount;` |
| `rio-builder/src/lib.rs` | `pub mod composefs;` + `rio_builder_digest_fuse_{open_seconds,fetch_bytes_total{hit},integrity_fail_total,eio_total}`. `// r[impl obs.metric.digest-fuse]` |
| tests | unit: `lookup` hex parsing round-trip; `resolve(unknown) == ENOENT`. `// r[verify builder.fs.digest-fuse-open]` |

**Mode summary:** cache hit → passthrough (zero further upcalls). Cache miss ≤ threshold → fetch-whole then passthrough. Cache miss > threshold → P0575 streaming during fill, then next open is passthrough. The FUSE `read` op is reachable only in the streaming window.

**Exit:** `.#ci` green (unit only).

### P0567 — `rio-mountd` DaemonSet (fd-handoff + `BACKING_OPEN` broker + `Promote`/`PromoteChunk`)
**Crate:** `rio-builder, infra` · **Deps:** P0576, P0578 · **Complexity:** MED (~250 LoC + helm)

The unprivileged builder cannot (a) loop-mount EROFS (no `FS_USERNS_MOUNT`), (b) open `/dev/fuse`, (c) call `FUSE_DEV_IOC_BACKING_OPEN`/`_CLOSE` (init-ns `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` — [`backing.c:91-93,147-149`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/fs/fuse/backing.c)), or (d) write the shared cache (integrity boundary). One DaemonSet per node with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` brokers all four. **No overlay mount, no upcall relay** — builder does FUSE-serve + `move_mount` + overlay itself.

**Concurrency:** tokio multi-thread runtime; one async task per accepted UDS connection. Within a conn, requests are length-prefix-framed and pipelined — `BackingOpen`/`BackingClose`/`PromoteChunk` are answered inline (sub-ms). `Promote` acquires a process-wide `Semaphore(num_cpus)` permit, then runs its copy+hash loop on `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` so it never blocks the conn's `BackingOpen` traffic. `// r[impl builder.mountd.concurrency]`

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `rio-builder/src/composefs/mountd_proto.rs` | new — UDS wire types shared with P0559. `struct Frame { seq: u32, body: Req\|Resp }` (every reply echoes `seq`; out-of-order replies from `spawn_blocking` `Promote` are correlatable). `enum Req { Mount{image_path, build_id}, BackingOpen{fd: RawFd}, BackingClose{id: u32}, PromoteChunks{chunk_digests: Vec<[u8;32]>}, Promote{digest: [u8;32]} }`. `enum Resp { Mounted{fuse_fd, erofs_fd, staging_quota_bytes: u64}, BackingId(u32), Promoted, Err(ErrKind) }`. `enum ErrKind { Retryable(String), DigestMismatch, NotRegular, TooLarge, RaceTimeout }` — builder maps `DigestMismatch`/`NotRegular`/`TooLarge` to **build-failure** (not infra-retry; re-fetch would loop). Length-prefix bincode framing; client holds `HashMap<u32, oneshot::Sender<Resp>>`. |
| `rio-builder/src/bin/rio-mountd.rs` | new — listens on `/run/rio-mountd.sock` (mode 0660, group `rio-builder`); rejects connections where `SO_PEERCRED.gid != rio-builder`.

Per accepted connection: **`Mount{image_path, build_id}`** → `fuse_fd = open("/dev/fuse", O_RDWR)`; **`kept = dup(fuse_fd)`** stored in conn state; `mount("none", "/var/rio/objects/{build_id}", "fuse.rio-digest", MS_NODEV\|MS_NOSUID, "fd=<fuse_fd>,rootmode=40555,user_id=<peer_uid>,group_id=<peer_gid>,allow_other,default_permissions")`; `mkdir -p /var/rio/staging/{build_id}/chunks` chown peer_uid; `conn.staging_dirfd = open(staging/{build_id}, O_DIRECTORY)`, `conn.staging_chunks_dirfd = openat(staging_dirfd, "chunks", O_DIRECTORY)`; `loop_dev = losetup_ro(image_path)`; `fsopen("erofs")` → `fsconfig(SET_STRING,"source",loop_dev)` → **`fsconfig(SET_FLAG,"ro")`** → `fsconfig(CMD_CREATE)` → `erofs_fd = fsmount(_, 0, MOUNT_ATTR_NODEV)`; reply `[fuse_fd, erofs_fd]` via SCM_RIGHTS; close sent copies. **`BackingOpen{fd}`** (fd via SCM_RIGHTS) → `ioctl(kept, FUSE_DEV_IOC_BACKING_OPEN, &fuse_backing_map{fd, flags:0}) → backing_id`; reply `backing_id` (mountd does not inspect the fd; the ioctl rejects depth>0 backing and `backing_id` is conn-scoped). **`BackingClose{id}`** → ioctl. **`PromoteChunks{chunk_digests}`** (batched, ≤64/batch) → for each: `openat(conn.staging_chunks_dirfd, hex, O_RDONLY\|O_NOFOLLOW)`; reject `!S_ISREG` or `st_size > FASTCDC_MAX_BYTES` (`rio-store/src/chunker.rs` constant — must match); read-all + verify `blake3 == chunk_digest`; write `/var/rio/chunks/ab/{hex}.tmp` 0444; rename (on `EEXIST` → already promoted, fine); unlink staging. One `Promoted` reply per batch. Runs inline. `// r[impl builder.fs.node-chunk-cache]` **`Promote{digest}`** → `src = openat(conn.staging_dirfd, hex, O_RDONLY\|O_NOFOLLOW)`; `fstat(src)` — reject `!S_ISREG` or `st_size > RIO_MOUNTD_MAX_PROMOTE_BYTES` (default 4 GiB). Create `cache/ab/{hex}.promoting` `O_EXCL\|O_WRONLY` 0444 — on `EEXIST`, stat `cache/ab/{hex}`: exists → reply `Promoted`; else inotify-wait ≤2 s then re-stat (or `Err("promote-race-timeout")`). Copy loop: `read(64 KiB)` with per-call `timeout(5s)` → `hasher.update` → `write`. Verify `hasher.finalize() == digest` else `unlink .promoting` + `Err("digest-mismatch")` + `promote_reject_total{reason="mismatch"}.inc()`. `rename .promoting → final`; `unlinkat(staging_dirfd, hex)`; reply `Promoted`. **On UDS conn-drop:** `umount2(objects_dir, MNT_DETACH)` + `losetup -d` + `rmdir(objects_dir)` + `rm -rf staging/{build_id}` + `close(kept)`. **Start-up:** scan `/var/rio/{objects,staging}/*` and `/var/rio/{cache,chunks}/**/*.{promoting,tmp}` for orphans; reap. `// r[impl builder.mountd.{erofs-handoff,backing-broker,promote-verified,orphan-scan}]` |

**Exit:** `.#ci` green; exercised end-to-end by P0560§B.

### P0571 — mountd-owned cache LRU sweep + staging-dir lifecycle + cache-hit metrics
**Crate:** `rio-builder, infra` · **Deps:** P0559, P0567 · **Complexity:** LOW

`r[builder.fs.shared-backing-cache]` + `r[builder.fs.node-chunk-cache]`: the **backing cache** (`/var/rio/cache/ab/<file_digest>`) and **chunk cache** (`/var/rio/chunks/ab/<chunk_digest>`) are mountd-owned, builder-readonly; builders stage to per-build `/var/rio/staging/{build_id}/` and `Promote`/`PromoteChunk` (P0567). Cross-build dedup for >threshold files is chunk-granular via the chunk cache.

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `rio-builder/src/bin/rio-mountd.rs` | mountd owns `/var/rio/{cache,chunks}/` (P0567); this plan adds the LRU sweep: periodic `statvfs` on each of `/var/rio/{cache,chunks,staging}` (may be separate partitions) — if `min(free%) < 10%`, atime-ordered `readdir` + `unlink` over `chunks/` first (intermediate, regenerable), then `cache/` (passthrough targets), until `min(free%) > 20%`. **Sweep also covers `/var/rio/staging/*`** (orphaned staging from crashed builds). **Cache, chunks, staging dirs MUST be on a non-stacking fs** (ext4/xfs; `r[builder.fs.passthrough-stack-depth]`). The disk-ownership freedom may be used to put `/var/rio/chunks/` on a dedicated partition to isolate IOPS from the build's overlay-upper. `// r[impl builder.fs.node-digest-cache]` |
| `rio-builder/src/composefs/digest_fuse.rs` | `rio_builder_objects_cache_{hit_total,bytes}` metrics. |
| `infra/helm/rio-build/templates/builder-sts.yaml` | hostPath `/var/rio/cache` mounted **RO**; `/var/rio/staging` and `/var/rio/objects` RW |
| `nix/nixos-node/eks-node.nix` | `systemd.tmpfiles.rules = ["d /var/rio/cache 0755 root root -" "d /var/rio/staging 0755 root root -" "d /var/rio/objects 0755 root root -"]` |

**FSx-backed cluster-wide cache rejected** — violates builder air-gap: a shared writable FS across untrusted builders is a cache-poisoning + lateral-movement surface. The same logic motivates mountd-owned per-node cache.

**Exit:** `.#ci` green.

### P0560 — [ATOMIC] composefs lower cutover: mount + DELETE old-FUSE + fixture kernel + VM test  ★ HARD CUTOVER
**Crate:** `rio-builder, nix` · **Deps:** P0576, P0556, P0557, P0559, P0567, P0571, P0575 · **Complexity:** HIGH (two-part atomic)

**One worktree, one PR, one `.#ci` gate.** §A alone breaks every existing VM test (fixtures lack `kernel.nix`; existing scenarios assert old-FUSE metrics); §B alone has nothing to test.

Hard-fail with actionable error if UDS connect fails (`"rio-mountd not running on this node — is the DaemonSet (P0567) deployed?"`) or any input's `NarIndex` is empty (`"store has not indexed {nar_hash} — is P0557 deployed?

### P0565 — Cutover runbooks
**Crate:** `docs` · **Deps:** P0555, P0562, P0564 · **Complexity:** LOW
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `docs/src/runbooks/tiered-cache-cutover.md` | new — flip `store.chunkBackend.kind=tiered`; rollback `kind=s3` |
| `docs/src/runbooks/mountd-crash-loop.md` | symptom: `kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total{container="rio-mountd"}` rising + node's builds `EIO`. Action: `kubectl logs -p`; if persistent, cordon node, drain builders, capture `/var/rio/{cache,staging}` listing. |
| `docs/src/runbooks/promote-reject-nonzero.md` | symptom: `rio_mountd_promote_reject_total{reason="mismatch"} > 0` — a builder presented bytes that don't hash to the claimed digest (rio-store corruption or compromised builder). Action: identify `build_id` from mountd log; check `rio_store_integrity_fail_total`; if store clean, treat the builder pod as suspect — cordon node, preserve staging dir for forensics. |
| `docs/src/runbooks/single-node-builds-slow.md` | triage tree: (1) `open_mode_total{mode="passthrough"} == 0` → kernel/init negotiation failed, check `dmesg`; (2) `promote_inflight` pegged → Promote backlog, check `cache_free_bytes`; (3) `mountd_request_seconds{op="backing_open"}` p99 > 1 ms → mountd CPU-starved; (4) else → upstream (`fetch_bytes_total{hit="remote"}` rate vs `rio_store_*`). |
| `docs/src/runbooks/composefs-cutover.md` | (1) ensure FSx flip done; (2) `xtask k8s eks down && up` from a P0562-green commit (greenfield — `nar_index` populates from scratch via PutPath eager + indexer_loop); (3) `xtask stress chromium`; (4) compare `fetch_bytes_total{hit="remote"}` — expect ≥10× reduction vs whole-NAR baseline on builds that touch <10% of files; expect `objects_cache_hit_ratio` climbing on repeat builds; (5) rollback = `down && up` from pre-P0560 commit |

**Exit:** `.#ci` green.

### P0575 — §2.7 mitigation (i): streaming `open()` for large files
**Crate:** `rio-builder` · **Deps:** P0559, P0570, P0571 · **Complexity:** LOW (~80 LoC) · **Priority: same tier as P0559**

**Unconditional** — top1000.csv shows all 1000 largest nixpkgs files >64 MiB (248 `.so`/`.a`, max 1.88 GiB); access-probe `42aa81b2` shows real consumers touch 0.3-33% (bimodal head+tail or scattered); spike `15a9db79` proves the mechanism works.

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `rio-builder/src/composefs/digest_fuse.rs` | **The during-fill mode** for P0559's case (c) — `size > STREAM_THRESHOLD` on cache miss. `open()` spawns fill task, returns `FOPEN_KEEP_CACHE` after the **first chunk** lands. **Chunk source (per chunk):** `open("/var/rio/chunks/ab/<chunk_hex>", O_RDONLY)` — success → write into `.partial` at offset; `ENOENT` → `GetChunks`, verify `blake3==chunk_digest`, write into `.partial` at offset **and** into `staging/chunks/<chunk_hex>`, append digest to a per-fill `Vec<[u8;32]>`. Every 32 chunks or at EOF: `PromoteChunks{batch}` (await reply, but assembly continues from own staging — `PromoteChunks` is purely for *other* builds; this build never reads `/var/rio/chunks/` for chunks it just fetched). **Staging quota**: track `staging_bytes`; if > `Mounted.staging_quota_bytes`, evict oldest `staging/chunks/*` (re-readable from `/var/rio/chunks/`). `read(off,len)`: filled → serve from `.partial`; else priority-bump and condvar-wait. On completion → whole-file blake3-verify → `rename .partial → <hex>` → `Promote{digest}`. Next `open()` is P0559 case (a). Prototype: `spike_stream_fuse.rs` (`15a9db79`). `// r[impl builder.fs.{streaming-open,node-chunk-cache}]` |
| `rio-builder/src/composefs/tests/stream.rs` | unit harness adapted from `spike_stream_fuse.rs`: tmpfs staging + mock mountd; assert `open()` of synth 32 MiB returns <50 ms with first-chunk landed; second open after fill is passthrough (read upcalls = 0). **Orphan**: pre-create unlocked `staging/<hex>.partial` → `open()` unlinks + refetches. |
| same | This IS the per-read-upcall behavior ADR-022 §1 rejected for the warm path — but it applies **only during the cold-fill window of the first open of a large file on that node**. After fill: **0 upcalls while pages remain cached**; under cgroup memory pressure evicted pages re-upcall and are re-served from the SSD backing file. The fill window cost is exactly `filesize / 128 KiB` upcalls, once. |
| `rio-builder/src/config.rs` | `stream_threshold_bytes: u64` (default `8 * 1024 * 1024`). |

**Exit:** `cargo nextest run -p rio-builder composefs::tests::stream` green (unit harness); `vm-composefs-e2e cold-read` is the integration check at P0560.

## Phase 7 — Directory DAG / delta-sync (U5; parallel with Phases 4-6 after P0546+P0572)

### P0573 — DirectoryService RPC surface
**Crate:** `rio-proto, rio-store` · **Deps:** P0572 · **Complexity:** MED
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `rio-proto/proto/store.proto` | `rpc GetDirectory(GetDirectoryRequest) returns (Directory)`; `rpc HasDirectories(HasDirectoriesRequest) returns (HasBitmap)`; `rpc HasBlobs(HasBlobsRequest) returns (HasBitmap)` — all batch (`repeated bytes digests = 1`; `HasBitmap { bytes bitmap = 1; }` one bit per request index, per **I-110 lesson**: per-digest unary against a 50k-node DAG is the PG wall again). Wire-compatible with snix `castore.proto`'s `DirectoryService.Get` where it overlaps. `// r[impl store.castore.directory-rpc]` |
| `rio-store/src/grpc/directory.rs` | new — all queries **tenant-scoped via junction** (`r[store.castore.tenant-scope]`): `get_directory(digest)`: `SELECT body FROM directories d JOIN directory_tenants t USING(digest) WHERE d.digest=$1 AND t.tenant_id=$2` (NotFound otherwise — body leaks child names/digests). `has_directories(digests)`: `SELECT d.digest FROM directories d JOIN directory_tenants t USING(digest) WHERE d.digest=ANY($1) AND t.tenant_id=$2` → bitmap. `has_blobs(file_digests)`: same shape via `file_blob_tenants`. `tenant_id` from JWT `Claims.sub`; fail-closed `UNAUTHENTICATED` if absent. |
| `migrations/033_nar_index.sql` (via P0572) | `CREATE TABLE file_blobs(digest bytea PRIMARY KEY, nar_hash bytea NOT NULL, nar_offset bigint NOT NULL, refcount integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0); CREATE TABLE file_blob_tenants (digest bytea NOT NULL REFERENCES file_blobs(digest) ON DELETE CASCADE, tenant_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES tenants(tenant_id) ON DELETE CASCADE, PRIMARY KEY (digest, tenant_id)); CREATE INDEX file_blob_tenants_tenant_idx ON file_blob_tenants (tenant_id, digest);` — populated in P0572's bottom-up pass via refcount-UPSERT (sorted UNNEST) + tenant-junction insert. **GIN-on-`nar_index.entries` is not viable**: `entries` is BYTEA (encoded proto), not JSONB, so a GIN expression index would require a proto-decoding `IMMUTABLE` PG function tied to the wire format (versioning hazard). The separate table is the derived index for `HasBlobs` AND carries the `(nar_hash, nar_offset)` coords P0574's `dag_sync` and P0577's `ReadBlob` key on. |
| `rio-store/src/lib.rs` | `rio_store_directory_{get_seconds,has_batch_size}` |
| tests | ephemeral PG: PutPath nested tree as tenant-A → `GetDirectory(root_digest)` returns correct children; `HasDirectories([root, unknown])` → `[1,0]` bitmap. **Cross-tenant denial**: tenant-B `HasDirectories([root])` → `[0]`; tenant-B `GetDirectory(root)` → NotFound; tenant-B `ReadBlob(file_digest)` → NotFound. `// r[verify store.castore.{directory-rpc,tenant-scope}]` |

**Exit:** `.#ci` green.

### P0577 — `BlobService.Read(file_digest)` server-stream
**Crate:** `rio-proto, rio-store` · **Deps:** P0573 · **Complexity:** LOW (~40 LoC)

Completes the snix-compatible castore surface: a client holding only a `file_digest` (from a `Directory` body) can fetch the bytes without knowing rio's chunk layout.

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `rio-proto/proto/store.proto` | `rpc ReadBlob(ReadBlobRequest) returns (stream BlobChunk)` — `ReadBlobRequest { bytes file_digest = 1; }`, `BlobChunk { bytes data = 1; }`. Wire-compatible with snix `castore.proto BlobService.Read`. `// r[impl store.castore.blob-read]` |
| `rio-store/src/grpc/directory.rs` | `read_blob(file_digest)`: `SELECT nar_hash, nar_offset FROM file_blobs f JOIN file_blob_tenants t USING(digest) WHERE f.digest=$1 AND t.tenant_id=$2` → resolve to chunk-range via the manifest's chunk cumsum (same `partition_point` as P0570) → stream via existing `GetChunks` machinery, slicing first/last chunk to the file boundary. NotFound if no tenant-scoped row. |
| tests | ephemeral PG: PutPath → `ReadBlob(file_digest)` body == original file content; `blake3(body) == file_digest`. `// r[verify store.castore.blob-read]` |

**Exit:** `.#ci` green.

### P0574 — Gateway substituter: Directory-DAG delta-sync client  ★ U5 LANDS
**Crate:** `rio-gateway` · **Deps:** P0573, P0577 · **Complexity:** MED
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `rio-gateway/src/substitute/dag_sync.rs` | new — `async fn sync_closure(local: &dyn LocalStore, remote: StoreClient, roots: &[StorePath])` → for each root, `GetNarIndex` → `root_digest`. BFS the Directory DAG: batch `HasDirectories(frontier)` against **local** store; for present digests, prune subtree; for absent, `GetDirectory(d)` → enqueue child dir digests + collect child `file_digest`s. After BFS: batch `HasBlobs(collected_file_digests)` against local; for absent, fetch via `GetChunks` (P0568) keyed by `DigestResolver`-style coords (P0573's `file_blobs` table provides them). Reassemble NARs locally from materialized blobs + Directory tree (NAR is derived, à la snix nar-bridge). `// r[impl gw.substitute.dag-delta-sync]` |
| `rio-gateway/src/substitute/mod.rs` | `nix copy --from rio://` path: if remote advertises `directory-service` capability AND closure `root_digest` is available, use `dag_sync`; else fall through to chunk-list path (today's behavior). |
| `rio-gateway/src/lib.rs` | `rio_gateway_dagsync_{subtrees_pruned_total,blobs_fetched_total,bytes_saved_total}` |
| `nix/tests/scenarios/dag-delta-sync.nix` | two-store fixture: store-A has closure v1; store-B has closure v2 (one file changed in a deep subdir). `nix copy --from rio://store-B` on store-A → assert `subtrees_pruned_total > (total_dirs × 0.9)` AND `blobs_fetched_total == 1`. |
| `nix/tests/default.nix` | `# r[verify gw.substitute.dag-delta-sync]` |

**Exit:** `.#ci` green; VM scenario demonstrates O(changed-subtrees) discovery.

## Rollback (one-flag for cache tier, greenfield for builder)

| Layer | Rollback | How |
|---|---|---|
| Tiered cache → direct-S3 | `store.chunkBackend.kind=s3` (helm) | Single flag, instant + lossless — S3 was always authoritative. |
| composefs → old-FUSE | **none** (old-FUSE deleted at P0560) | `xtask k8s eks down && up` from a pre-P0560 commit. Greenfield principle. |

**Helm assertion** (`_helpers.tpl`, P0564): `{{- if and .Values.karpenter.enabled (not (has "OVERLAY_FS_DATA_ONLY" .Values.karpenter.amiKernelFeatures)) }}{{ fail "AMI must be built with nix/nixos-node/kernel.nix (≥6.16, EROFS+OVERLAY+FUSE); run xtask ami push" }}{{- end }}`.

## Explicitly deferred (out of scope)

- Non-reproducibility `nar_hash` mismatch detection at PutPath
- Per-replica chunk-dedup metrics
- aarch64-specific encoder/mount validation (proptest covers; live aarch64 builder is the soak; P0543 covers config-eval only)
- **`libcomposefs` upstream PRs** (good citizenship; we carry the nix patch so neither blocks) — (a) `LCFS_BUILD_USER_XATTR_OVERLAY` flag to emit `user.overlay.*` instead of `trusted.*`; (b) `LCFS_FLAGS_NO_ROOT_WHITEOUTS` to skip the 256 OCI chardev whiteouts + root opaque. If both land, drop `nix/patches/libcomposefs-user-xattr.patch`.
- **`mkfs.erofs --tar=headerball` fallback** — upstream `erofs-utils` (≥1.8) purpose-built mode for meta-only overlay data-only layers; ~160 LoC PAX-header emitter + subprocess, ~280 ms / 23k files (spike-verified at `~/tmp/spike-headerball/`). Zero-patch option; switch to it if patch maintenance or `libcomposefs` ABI churn becomes a problem.
- **Kernel `BACKING_OPEN` `d_is_reg` relaxation** — [`backing.c:105-108`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/fs/fuse/backing.c) rejects block-device fds. If lifted upstream, `ublk`-per-giant becomes a viable shared-verified-partial primitive (still needs chunk-addressed verify underneath, but would let B passthrough A's in-progress fill).
- **fs-verity on the digest cache** — would give kernel-side integrity for warm reads from `/var/rio/objects`, but requires a real fs (not FUSE) as the data-only lower. Possible future: digest-FUSE materializes into an ext4/xfs hostPath with fs-verity, overlay's lower2 is that dir directly (no FUSE on warm path at all). Followup after P0562.
- **Cross-region deployment** — globally-consistent metadata store, object-store cross-region replication, per-region cache tiers. This plan ensures forward-compat (object-store-authoritative, cache tier stateless) but does not implement it.
- **Upload-path file-granular dedup** — builder→store via `HasBlobs`+`BlobService.Put` instead of whole-NAR `PutPath`. Requires reworking the `NarHash` signature unit and refscan placement; candidate follow-on ADR.
